              <p>
                I'm a software engineer by trade (if you want to learn more,

                ), but at my core I'm a Serial Dabbler â€” I like rock climbing
                and building stuff, and have a casual relationship with a few
                musical instruments and singing. I'm always in motion and love
                trying new things.

                This site is the central hub for all my musings, learnings, and
                adventures. My goal is to keep growing as a person and document
                my process, not only for myself but for whoever happens to
                stumble upon my little corner of the internet.
              </p>
              <p>That's all for now, hope you enjoy!</p>

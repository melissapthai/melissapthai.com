              Hi, hello!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a software engineer by trade (if you want to learn more, check out
              my resume), but at my core I'm a Serial Dabbler â€” I like rock climbing
              and building stuff, and have a casual relationship with a few musical
              instruments and singing. I'm always in motion and love trying new things.
            </p>
            <p>
              This site is the central hub for all my musings, learnings, and adventures. 
              My goal is to keep growing as a person and document my process, not only 
              for myself but for whoever happens to stumble upon my little corner of the 
              internet.
            </p>
            <p>So that's it, hope you enjoy!</p>
